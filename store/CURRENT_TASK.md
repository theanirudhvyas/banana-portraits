# CURRENT TASK

## 📋 Task: Enhanced Terminal-Based Image Editor for Nano Banana Portrait

### Background
The nano-banana project is a Python CLI tool for AI portrait generation using FAL API with support for image editing and session management. Recent work has added:

- Advanced terminal-based TUI editors (`session_editor_ui.py`, `split_editor_ui.py`)
- Enhanced image preview with chafa integration (`image_preview.py`)
- Session-based iterative editing functionality
- Database tracking of edit steps and sessions

### Current Status
**In Progress**: Enhanced TUI editor system with high-quality image preview

#### Completed ✅
- [🧑‍💻] Created session-based editor UI with step tracking
- [🧑‍💻] Created split-screen editor UI for browsing generations  
- [🧑‍💻] Enhanced image preview system with chafa integration
- [🧪] Basic testing and verification of TUI functionality

#### Remaining Tasks 📋

1. [🧪] **VERIFY** current editor implementations work correctly
   - Test session editor with actual image editing workflow
   - Test split editor browsing functionality
   - Verify chafa image preview quality and compatibility
   
2. [🏗️] **DESIGN** comprehensive test suite for editor components
   - Unit tests for ImagePreviewWidget rendering
   - Integration tests for session workflow
   - Functional tests for TUI interaction

3. [🧑‍💻] **IMPLEMENT** any missing functionality discovered in testing
   - Error handling improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - UI/UX enhancements

4. [📚] **LEARN** patterns for TUI testing and store examples

5. [🧪] **VERIFY** full editing workflow end-to-end
   - Create new session from image
   - Apply multiple edits in sequence
   - Verify all images generate and display correctly

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Session editor launches and displays correctly
- [ ] Split editor shows generation history
- [ ] Chafa image preview renders without errors
- [ ] Edit operations complete successfully
- [ ] Database properly tracks all steps
- [ ] Error states display appropriately

### Files Modified
- `src/session_editor_ui.py` - Session-based iterative editing TUI
- `src/split_editor_ui.py` - Split-screen generation browser TUI  
- `src/image_preview.py` - Enhanced terminal image preview
- `src/cli.py` - Integration of new editor commands
- `src/database.py` - Session support and step tracking

### Next Actions
[🧪] Start with comprehensive verification of current implementations before proceeding with additional enhancements.
